# RawData ReadMe

This folder contains raw data coming from multiple collaborators.
Each type of data is in its own folder.
See [GitHub/byandell/FounderDietStudy](https://github.com/byandell/FounderDietStudy) (in particular [DataHarmony.Rmd](https://github.com/byandell/FounderDietStudy/blob/main/DataHarmony.Rmd)) for details on data harmonization.

See each subfolder for information on that type of data.
Scientists creating data should be (!) responsible for ReadMe and metadata in these folders.
