# RawData ReadMe

This folder `/mnt/researchdrive/adattie/General/founder_diet_study/RawData/`
contains raw data coming from multiple collaborators.

Each type of data is in its own folder.
See [GitHub/byandell/FounderDietStudy](https://github.com/byandell/FounderDietStudy) (in particular [DataHarmony.Rmd](https://github.com/byandell/FounderDietStudy/blob/main/DataHarmony.Rmd)) for details on data harmonization.
The file `source.csv` contains information used to access and identify data sources.

See each subfolder for information on that type of data.
Scientists creating data should be (!) responsible for ReadMe and metadata in these folders.
