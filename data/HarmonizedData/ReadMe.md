# HarmonizedData ReadMe

This folder `/mnt/researchdrive/adattie/General/founder_diet_study/HarmonizedData/`
contains harmonized data coming from multiple collaborators.

Each type of data is in its own folder.
See [GitHub/byandell/FounderDietStudy](https://github.com/byandell/FounderDietStudy) (in particular [DataHarmony.Rmd](https://github.com/byandell/FounderDietStudy/blob/main/DataHarmony.Rmd)) for details on data harmonization.
The file `../RawData/source.csv` contains sources used to access and identify data sources.

See each subfolder for information on that type of data.
Data scientists creating harmonized should be (!) responsible for ReadMe and metadata in these folders,
which will eventually be automated.

- `Enrich`
- `LivMet`
- `LivRna`
- `Module`: module information derived from harmonized data
- `Normalized`: normal scores normalized data used in shiny app
- `Obsolete`: legacy files to be removed eventually
- `Physio`
- `PlaMet0`
- `PlaMet120`
- `Unnormalized`: experimental files
